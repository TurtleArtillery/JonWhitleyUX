        <p>
            This is the website for the company for whom I currently work. 
            It's a website for a small Houston-area environmental professional 
            consulting company. They provide a diverse array of environmentally 
            related services. I built it entirely from scratch. 
            <br><br>
            The website is currently live at <a href="www.i2massoc.com">i2mAssoc.com.</a>
            <br><br>
            I came to this project as the company was undergoing a change in structure,
            where the company, "Industrial Mining and Mineral", split into "I2M Associates" 
            and "I2M Consulting". "I2M Consulting" kept the existing "I2M" website, and I was 
            brought in to build the website for "I2M Associates". The former website can be
            found at <a href="https://i2mconsulting.com">i2mconsulting.com</a>.
            <br><br>
            Working with the CEO of I2M Associates I started by identifying what they hoped
            to accomplish with the website: <strong>to bring in clients.</strong>
            <br><br>
            I'm a big fan of minimalism. I try to design by German Industrial Designer
            Dieter Rams' principle: <strong>"Less but better."</strong>
            <br><br>
            So what's the most critical information for anyone looking to hire an environmental
            consultant? <strong>Who you are, what you do, and how to contact you.</strong> 
            So I put all of that information right up front on the home page. 
            <br><br>
            Secondary to that we go more granular with what specific services the 
            company provides and names and brief bios for the various consultants
            with the company (that page is not yet live.) The CEO also requested that 
            I add a page to address the specific industry sectors in which they are
            qualified to work. 
            <br><br>
            We also decided to include a page of abbreviated case-studies. It was requested
            that I create multiple case-study pages to handle different types of case-studies.
            I felt as though listing multiple such pages within the nav-structure would just
            make the site feel heavy and confusing, so within the "case-studies" page I created
            a table with a tab-structure. I like how it turned out, and now I have my own 
            blueprint for tab-tables, without having to import a design library like 
            Twitter Bootstrap. Unfortunately both this page and the "Associates" page remain
            under construction, so they are not visible on the website, but you can see a 
            screenshot of the prototype "Case-Studies" page at the top of this article.
