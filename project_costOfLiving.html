        <p>
            This project came about when I was once asked, as I’m 
            sure you’ve been asked, “What is your desired salary 
            range?” But it was for a city across the country and 
            after swimming through salary comparison charts and 
            “living-wage tables” I still had no idea. So I decided 
            I wanted an app that would estimate what sort of life 
            I would have on a given salary.
            <br><br>
            The Challenge: Design an app that would take a salary 
            and location and provide a rough estimate of how the 
            expenses play out.
            <br><br>
            The Solution: I think ultimately why there are no apps 
            like this is that there are simply so many variables to 
            consider. So I decided the app would default to average 
            values for the location, (eg. Average monthly grocery 
            bill for a family of 2 adults) but allow users to 
            override these default estimates if they wanted a 
            more accurate result.
            <br><br>
            To design it I sat down and ran through several 
            calculations of my own to rough out what exactly were 
            the expenses that should be considered. Then I tried to 
            organize them into a logical structure. I organized 
            them largely according to which categories would take 
            inputs the same way and which needed special attention. 
            For instance, I wanted Housing to be a separate tab so 
            that I could be a little more flexible with the UI, since 
            I wanted to have the option to switch between Apartment, 
            House-Rent, House-Mortgage, and House-Own and each of 
            those might have a different effect on the amount 
            estimated in the Taxes section. I also wanted the 
            option to add multiple residences and residences that 
            aren’t necessarily in the same city as listed on the 
            main screen. Overall, I’m pleased with the result.
            <br><br>
