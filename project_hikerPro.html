        <p>
            I was inspired to create this design by my current running app. I 
            won’t tell you which one I use because, well, it inspired me by 
            crashing rather badly. I designed this app as a bit of a therapeutic 
            exercise after the app I currently used crashed for probably the 
            dozenth time. I use it nearly every day but it has brought me a lot 
            of frustration. It crashes frequently, which is not a design problem, 
            but it’s also crammed to the gills with superfluous social media 
            functions that just get in the way. I mean, come on guys, who really 
            wants to share a selfie of themselves looking all haggard and sweaty? 
            Maybe it’s a great function for the top-tier athletes and models who 
            advertise it, but the post-run look would not be a good look for me. 
            I might switch to another app, but I already have over 2500 miles logged.
            <br><br>
            I ultimately decided to design an app geared toward adventure hiking 
            and there were three key features I knew I really wanted to have with 
            this app: distance traveled, GPS tagged route tracking, and a 3D 
            topographic map. Beyond that I did some research to determine what 
            other metrics and features would be good to include.
            <br><br>
            There really aren’t many well-designed hiking apps on the market right now, 
            so it was tough to do research specifically on them; the next best thing 
            turned out to be running apps. There are several quite well designed running 
            apps that, of course, you could co-opt to use while walking – in fact, almost 
            all of the major shoe brands have one. Common practices noted were: a 
            start/pause/stop button, pace tracking, heart-rate, elapsed time, photo tagging, 
            and distance traveled. Some of these I wanted, some not. Pace tracking could 
            be a neat metric to record, but qualitative color grading is almost 
            counter-productive in adventure-hiking, where it is as much or more about the 
            journey as the exercise. Heart rate seemed significantly less important in a 
            hiking app; you aren’t going to hit your “target heart-rate” by hiking unless 
            you live in Colorado. But the photo tagging and start/pause/stop buttons gave 
            me some good ideas to work with.
            <br><br>
            My final features list: start/pause/stop buttons, GPS and Elevation tracking, 
            distance tracking, elapsed time, photo tagging, and old hike reviewing.
            <br><br>
            During the design phase the “pause” button evolved into a “camp” button to pause 
            the tracking and save the current data to the disk so that a hiker can turn their 
            phone off for the night to save battery without having to split their journey into 
            multiple “hikes” within the app. I also added a button to create a “waypoint” on the 
            map; this function would work similarly to taking a picture – it would simply set 
            down a GPS point on the map and allow you to write a brief note about that point and 
            time on your journey. For the more secondary features, account settings and so forth, 
            I opted for the ever-popular top-right hamburger menu. For a color scheme I decided 
            to use colors reminiscent of my own hiking days with the Scouts; classic color choices 
            back then included a muted, hunter-green and a darker brick red. I also included an 
            inlaid compass, because with a compass overlaid on a topographical map, it’s a lot 
            harder to get lost.
            <br><br>
            I quite like the final product, made entirely in Sketch. I concluded this project 
            with some nice, full-color renders and a few new handmade icons to add to my library.
