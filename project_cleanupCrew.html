        <p>
            The idea for this comes from a campaign I saw promoted when 
            I was in Dallas: several posters advertised that you could 
            take a GPS-tagged photo of garbage or graffiti and text it 
            to the city and they would come and clean it up. I thought 
            that was such a fantastic idea and I wanted to design a way 
            to make it easily extensible to any city in the world.
            <br><br>
            The idea for this is to provide a way for people to report 
            garbage or graffiti or whatever else you might find, even 
            if you might not have the time or ability to clean it up 
            for yourself. Anyone can report garbage or broken windows, 
            and anyone can clean them up and clear them from the map. 
            The ultimate goal is to gamify cleaning up the environment.
            <br><br>
            First things first, I sat down to really think about what 
            needed to be included in the app. Actually, I didn’t sit down. 
            I took a walk. I went out into the neighborhood and walked around 
            just looking for things that were broken or otherwise in need 
            of fixing. I found that there really is a depressing amount of 
            trash just lying around. I actually saw trash (how shocking, 
            right?), and broken windows, a broken street-lamp, and graffiti. 
            Someone had thrown a shopping cart into the creek. I saw water 
            welling up from a damp spot in someone’s yard where a pipe must 
            have burst and it spilled wastefully into the street. These things 
            informed some of the specific choices I made in designing this app.
            <br><br>
            For instance: critically there had to be a function for GPS-tagging; 
            there had to be a function for identifying specifically what was 
            gps-tagged. There had to be a function for viewing tags put up by 
            other users and a function for dismissing tags that were no longer 
            necessary. This was the core functionality of the app. I came to the 
            design with three categories originally in mind: litter, graffiti, and 
            wasted water, but as I designed I decided to include a few more. I 
            ended up with eight – “Recycling bins”, “Trash-Cans”, “Graffiti”, 
            “Litter”, “Damage”, “Bio-Hazard”, “Wasted Water”, and “Road Damage”. 
            A posting user would then have the ability to enter a brief 
            description of what was tagged, so that other users would be able to 
            plan accordingly – for instance, if someone posts “Somebody dropped a 
            broken refrigerator over the riverbank.” then other users know that not 
            just anybody is going to fix that particular problem.
