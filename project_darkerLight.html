                Last year I was applying for a job in which the job 
                description specified, "MUST HAVE EXPERIENCE DESIGNING 
                E-COMMERCE APPS!!!" Like, it was 2017. Honestly, what self 
                respecting designer doesn't have experience designing 
                for e-commerce?<br><br>
                
                Well, me.<br><br>
                
                Hence my challenge: Design the best, most thematically 
                driven e-commerce app the world has ever seen. I wanted it 
                to have a specific theme out of which I could draw a whole 
                design scheme. I decided to do the whole site around an 
                extremely high-contrast black and white color scheme.<br><br>
                
                With that in mind I wanted to really reduce a shopping 
                experience to the basics. So what does that mean? Well, 
                first we have to have a way to find what you're looking for. 
                A search function helps with that, but it probably shouldn't 
                be the primary approach. We'll need to have a list of 
                merchandise. We'll need a way of differentiating between 
                men's and women's clothes. Given the fashion-heavy theme for 
                the site, I thought it would be appropriate to add a system
                for measurement customization. And of course we'll need a 
                cart and we'll need a checkout. We'll also need some method 
                for navigating to the more mundane aspects of our business' 
                information such as "careers" and "return policies" and whatnot.
                <br><br>
                Research indicates a common thread (pun intended) in online 
                shopping layouts is a simple vertical list. Kohls, Target, eBay, 
                Amazon - all of them use the simple vertical list. But once you've 
                arrived, what if you're looking for something other than the categories 
                immediately displayed? Well, most of the time you have either to 
                search for what you want or use a filter checkbox, sometimes both. 
                So I decided to try experimenting with a different sort of 
                interaction for the main function, instead drawing more from the 
                layout of Netflix, with a primary vertical column of side-scrolling 
                carousels. From that point it seemed a simple enough journey, first 
                through a product-detail page wherein a user would select sizes, 
                read reviews, and place an order into the cart, through to the 
                cart view itself, and then finally on to checkout. The navigation 
                for the primary function of placing an order should be fairly 
                linear, with the option to circle back around to the start from 
                the cart to continue shopping. For navigation to all of the 
                secondary elements of the business I decided to opt of the 
                simplicity of a hamburger menu.

            I concluded this project with a low-fi prototype.<br>
            I built this prototype app wholly in Adobe XD. Please check out 
            the interactive prototype at -

            I did not invest too much time in user-testing this app, primarily 
            because, well, the position I was applying for fell through before 
            I could, but what testing I did conduct yielded fairly frustrating results:
            <br><br>
            There were a few complaints about the design being too harsh to look at, 
            that all of the back and forth in tint made the design really busy to look at, 
            despite the restriction to two colors. But the most frequent comment I 
            received was "But what is it?" It seems that "The Darker Light" is a name 
            which simply does not imply clothes shopping, and without pictures of the 
            clothing it was hard to recognize that the app was meant to sell clothes. 
            Functional side-scrolling elements in the main column may also have helped 
            explain the design.
            <br><br>
            I approached the project a second time. I didn't redesign the whole app, 
            because for the most part I felt like the design worked well. My main point 
            of concern was with the home page. I felt like it was just too complicated, 
            and the pictures were just too small. The design itself was a little boring 
            for a fashion app. I had in mind that the fashions sold through the app 
            should be put on a pedestal, so with that in mind I decided the whole front 
            page should essentially be a big image carousel, which I've filled out with 
            some nice Creative Commons Licensed images. I have this idea of "fashion" 
            being this world of arcane symbols and unspoken rules (maybe just because 
            I don't understand it), and I felt like the system of little tabs with 
            symbols on them fit with that dynamic - to be mysterious, but not opaque.
            <br><br>
            Here are my updated wireframes, with integrated changes from from my research.
