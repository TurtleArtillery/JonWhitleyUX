        <p>
            This was by far my biggest, most work-intensive UX 
            project to date. It took weeks to create the full, 
            high-fidelity prototype. That being said, I think it 
            turned out well.
            <br><br>
            First things first, I noticed one day that while most 
            hospital systems have decent enough desktop websites 
            their mobile versions are almost uniformly lacking. 
            I decided I could do better. The final product is 
            designed as a basic blueprint that could be implemented 
            by any hospital system that wished to do so.
            <br><br>
            Here's the final prototype - <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/04f2d2e3-8141-4864-99fe-4a5a01279e93/">Alchemist Health Providers Prototype.</a>
            <br><br>
            So my first steps were to research a wide spectrum of 
            existing hospital websites and sit down and determine 
            the most important parts of a hospital's website.
            <br><br>
            The most crucial user case I kept in mind was someone 
            accessing the hospital's website in the midst of an 
            emergency. I don't know if someone would actually take 
            the time to visit a webpage in such an instance, but I 
            wanted to prepare for that case nonetheless. So what 
            does a user need most from a website in an emergency? 
            It seems to me that clarity and a very clear to follow 
            are the most important. So I placed the button for the 
            emergency track in the place your eye goes to first and 
            I made the button the only red item on the entire page, 
            set against gray, black, and a darker purple. The next 
            step along the line leads into a page with buttons for 
            information or locations for emergency services and the 
            ability to alert the hospital that you're coming. This 
            last function is less a UX function and more a part of 
            the greater Experience Design of the whole hospital 
            system.
            <br><br>
            Beyond that I provide a direct line toward general 
            hospital information, a path toward a portal for 
            patients and another for physicians, a streamlined 
            button specifically for finding a doctor, and a final 
            button for looking up the hospital blog and hospital 
            sponsored events.
            <br><br>
            There are a lot more frames to this prototype than 
            I have chosen to display here, literally over 100 
            of them. Check out the prototype above to click 
            through all of them.
