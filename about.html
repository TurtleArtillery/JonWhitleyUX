            Hi! So by now you’ve seen my work and you might be wondering, 
            “gosh, who is this person who has designed such wonderful 
            user-experiences?”
            <br><br>
            The short answer is: I’m Jon.
            <br><br>
            A slightly longer answer is: I’m an Interaction Designer. 
            My specialties are UX Design and Information Architecture, 
            with a focus in mobile design.
            <br><br>
            I graduated Magna-Cum-Laude from UT Dallas in 2014 with a BA 
            in Arts and Technology and a Minor in Arts and Performance. 
            I also enjoy Writing, Animation, Video/Photography, Graphic 
            Design, Programming, and Game Design.
            <br><br>
            But who am I as a person?
            <br><br>
            I could write a whole long entry about my personality, 
            but that’s probably too heavy, so let’s just do this FAQ style:
            </p>

            <p class="aboutFAQ">
            <br><br>
            <span class="aboutQuestions">Q: What tools do I work with?</span>
            <br><br>
            A: Sketch, Axure RP, Adobe XD, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
            <br><br>
            <span class="aboutQuestions">Q: Can I write code?</span>
            <br><br>
            A: Yeah, some. I can do light scripting. I like to use it to drive animation.
            <br><br>
            <span class="aboutQuestions">Q: Am I a developer?</span>
            <br><br>
            A: No. I’m a designer who can code.
            <br><br>
            <span class="aboutQuestions">Q: Can I translate between designers and engineers?</span>
            <br><br>
            A: Absolutely.
            <br><br>
            <span class="aboutQuestions">Q: Am I for or against the Oxford Comma?</span>
            <br><br>
            A: For, definitely for.
            <br><br>
            <span class="aboutQuestions">Q: Am I an introvert or an extrovert?</span>
            <br><br>
            A: Introverted, generally speaking.
            <br><br>
            <span class="aboutQuestions">Q: Dogs or cats?</span>
            <br><br>
            A: Dogs. Cats can be good, but I prefer dogs.
            <br><br>
            <span class="aboutQuestions">Q: What do I do for fun?</span>
            <br><br>
            A: Write fiction, study languages, make cookies.
            <br><br>
            <span class="aboutQuestions">Q: Are my cookies any good?</span>
            <br><br>
            A: You bet.
            <br><br>
            <span class="aboutQuestions">Q: What languages do I speak?</span>
            <br><br>
            A: English natively, and my German and Spanish aren’t so bad. I also studied some Latin.
            <br><br>
            <span class="aboutQuestions">Q: Am I funny?</span>
            <br><br>
            A: Is anyone who says they’re funny ever actually funny? That being said, I love puns. Like this, “Why can’t seagulls fly over bays? Because then they’d be bagels!” (Get it? Bay-Gulls?)
            <br><br>
            <span class="aboutQuestions">Q: Have I written anything good?</span>
            <br><br>
            A: I like to think so. I wrote a bunch of screenplays, some Game story-scripts, and a novel.
            <br><br>
            <span class="aboutQuestions">Q: Anything published?</span>
            <br><br>
            A: Nope. I just like writing.
            <br><br><br>
            So that’s me.
            <br><br>
            Who are you?
